A realm where the players can place items and monsters in an area
possible a separate app?
purely Aesthetic -- 
a decorative universe? 
Algorithmic generation of gear/monster models, that can be refined later?
like virtual funkos, freely decorative -- life size, decoartive wall hanging, anything really.
